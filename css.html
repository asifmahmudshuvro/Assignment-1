                <p class="why-dev-description">CSS is used to style and layout web pages. It controls the visual presentation of HTML elements, including their color, size, position, and overall look. Key features of CSS include:

                    Selectors: Selectors are used to target HTML elements. For example, h1 targets all < h1 > elements, while .className targets all elements with the class className.
                    Properties and Values: CSS rules are made up of properties and values. For example, color: red; sets the text color to red.
                    Box Model: CSS treats elements as boxes with properties like margin, border, padding, and content.
                    Responsive Design: Using media queries, CSS can adapt the layout to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a good user experience across all platforms.
                    Flexbox and Grid: These modern layout systems provide more efficient ways to arrange elements on the page.
